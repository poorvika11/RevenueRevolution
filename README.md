## Revenue Revolution- A comprehensive analysis of sales data

I have planned to collect the data from a Maha Lakshmi Mart, a multipurpose store, situated in
Ghaziabad-201206 for the last 3 years. It is a retail establishment that sells a wide variety of
products and services, catering to the needs of diverse customer segments. It is a B2C business,
meaning it sells goods to customers. From groceries and household items to electronics, and home
appliances, it has it all.I have talked to the manager about the monthly money it brings in and identified the issues with its
lower sales volume as compared to other establishments in the neighborhood. The other issue he
brought up included products that go bad in this undertaking. With the
investigation of sales variables and other factors like quantity, revenue, and profit analysis, the
project is anticipated to answer the issues raised by the management. The project will perform a
thorough analysis to identify the improvements required to boost income and reduce waste.

### Excel sheet has the data and the details how data has been analysed.
